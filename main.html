	<summary>
		In a village in Rajasthan, Durga Singh is a poor woman raising her two beloved sons Karan and Arjun.
		When Munshiji of Thakur Sangram Singh, comes to talk to Durga, she tells her husband was the Thakur's son who married her against his father's wishes.
		Durjan Singh, a relative of Thakur killed Durga's husband to prevent him or his family from inheriting the Thakur's estate.
        After learning that Thakur plans to sign over the estate to Karan and Arjun, Durjan kills Thakur,
		before brutally murdering Karan and Arjun with his brothers-in-law Nahar and Shamsher.
		Durga worships Goddess Kali to bring her sons back. Miraculously, her prayers are heard and the two are reincarnated,
		but are separated and grown into different families unaware of their past lives.
		Durga is unaware of this miracle, but she still believes that her sons will return one day.
